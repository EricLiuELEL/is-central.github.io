# General Strategy
The general strategy of Ice Age is as follow:
- Do not let ice slugs pile up, you should be looking to seperate them, have them killed away from your important operators
- Cry because you are getting no spine out of this stage
- Imagine if this is Bad Neighbors, you would be profiting, sadge.
